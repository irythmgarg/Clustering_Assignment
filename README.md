# Clustering_Assignment

ðŸ§ª Clustering Analysis on the Iris Dataset
This repository implements multiple clustering algorithms on the Iris dataset and evaluates their performance using various metrics across different preprocessing techniques and cluster sizes.

ðŸ“Œ Overview
The project involves:

Applying Spectral Clustering, Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), and Fuzzy C-Means

Using three preprocessing methods: Standard Scaling, Min-Max Scaling, and Normalization

Evaluating performance for cluster counts of 3, 5, and 7

Comparing results using three clustering evaluation metrics

ðŸ§¹ Data Preprocessing
The dataset is preprocessed using:

StandardScaler (Standard Scaling)

MinMaxScaler (Min-Max Scaling)

Normalizer (L2 Normalization)

Each preprocessing technique is independently applied before clustering.

ðŸ“Š Clustering Algorithms
Implemented clustering methods:

Spectral Clustering

Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)

Fuzzy C-Means (via skfuzzy)
